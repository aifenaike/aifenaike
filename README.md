Data Scientist | Machine Learning Developer
Welcome to my GitHub repository! I'm a passionate Data Scientist and Machine Learning Developer dedicated to the art of extracting meaningful insights from data and building intelligent systems.

I enjoy building real-time data-driven applications but I mostly work on and experiment with machine learning driven APIs of all sort.
